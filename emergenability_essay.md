# Emergenability: A Theoretical Framework for Latent Systemic Potential in Therapeutic Change

**Abstract**

This essay introduces the neologism "emergenability" to describe the latent capacity of psychic, relational, and narrative systems to emerge when encountering adequate configurational conditions within their surrounding networks. Drawing upon convergent insights from philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, and systems theory, this framework addresses a significant conceptual gap in understanding how therapeutic potentials activate. The concept bridges Bergson's virtual/actual distinction, Deleuze's assemblage theory, contemporary neuroscience on plasticity and criticality, narrative therapy practices, and complex systems dynamics. Emergenability offers both theoretical rigor and practical applicability, providing a unifying framework for understanding and facilitating therapeutic emergence across diverse modalities and contexts.

## 1. Introduction: The Need for a New Concept

In clinical practice, experienced therapists often describe moments when they sense a patient's readiness for change—a quality of potential that seems to hover on the threshold of actualization, waiting for the right conditions to manifest. This phenomenon, while universally recognized in therapeutic work, has lacked precise conceptual articulation. Existing terms such as "readiness for change," "therapeutic potential," or "emerging capacity" capture aspects of this reality but fail to convey the full dynamic complexity of latent systemic capacities awaiting activation through specific configurational conditions.

The neologism "emergenability" addresses this conceptual lacuna. Derived from the morphological pattern [emergent + -ability], it denotes the inherent capacity of systems—whether psychic, relational, narrative, or neurobiological—to actualize latent potentials when encountering appropriate environmental, relational, and temporal conditions. Unlike simple possibility or readiness, emergenability implies a more active, latent reality: potentials that exist in virtual form and can be systematically activated through understanding and manipulation of systemic conditions.

This concept emerges from clinical observation but finds robust theoretical foundation across multiple disciplines. From Henri Bergson's durée and élan vital to contemporary neuroscience on critical brain dynamics, from Deleuze's assemblage theory to Michael White's "absent but implicit," diverse theoretical traditions converge on recognizing latent capacities that await optimal conditions for actualization.

## 2. Philosophical Foundations: Virtuality and Becoming

### 2.1 Bergsonian Duration and Creative Evolution

Henri Bergson's philosophical framework provides foundational concepts for understanding emergenability. His distinction between the virtual and the actual positions the virtual as "fully real" but not yet actualized—existing as pure potentiality that, when actualized, creates genuine novelty rather than merely revealing pre-existing forms.

[Bergson's *durée*](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/) suggests that emergence possesses its own temporal logic—potentials must "ripen" through the qualitative interpenetration of moments. This process cannot be mechanically predicted or forced; it requires what we might call "durational readiness." The [*élan vital*](https://philosophiesoflife.org/elan-vital-and-henri-bergsons-philosophy/) provides a model for understanding emergenability as creative, differentiating force that actualizes in diverse forms not as fixed essence, but as dynamic process of becoming that encounters material resistance and transforms it creatively.

Clinical emergenability thus operates through Bergsonian time rather than chronological time. Therapeutic moments of emergence occur when the patient's durational flow reaches a point of creative tension where virtual potentials press toward actualization. The therapist's role becomes one of creating conditions that support this natural temporal unfolding rather than imposing external timelines or expectations.

### 2.2 Deleuzian Assemblages and Immanent Potency

[Gilles Deleuze](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/) develops these Bergsonian insights through his theory of assemblages (agencements), where emergenability manifests as "production of new conjugations"—multiplicities entering novel arrangements that generate emergent properties. The concept of *puissance* (immanent potency)—the capacity to affect and be affected—becomes central to understanding how systems possess latent capabilities activated through rhizomatic connections.

[Deleuze's tripartite ontology](https://www.academia.edu/30551625/The_life_and_the_crystal_Paths_into_the_virtual_in_Bergson_Simondon_and_Deleuze) (virtual-intensive-actual) precisely explains how latent capacities manifest: Virtual Ideas as differential fields of potential undergo intensive processes of actualization, resulting in actual entities that maintain connection to virtual potential. In therapeutic terms, this suggests that every presenting problem contains virtual dimensions—alternative potentials that can be activated through appropriate intensive interventions.

The Deleuzian framework positions emergenability not as property of individual subjects but as relational capacity emerging from assemblages that include therapist, patient, setting, timing, cultural context, and even material conditions. Change occurs through reconfiguration of these assemblages rather than through direct intervention on isolated components.

### 2.3 Phenomenological Horizons of Possibility

[The phenomenological tradition](https://iep.utm.edu/phenom/) contributes crucial insights about how consciousness always possesses a "horizon of potentialities" (Husserl), how Dasein exists as "thrown project" that projects possibilities (Heidegger), and how the body-subject possesses "motor intentionality" that grasps possibilities before conceptual understanding (Merleau-Ponty).

[Merleau-Ponty's embodied phenomenology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/merleau-ponty/) particularly illuminates therapeutic emergenability: the lived body continuously anticipates possibilities through its motor schemas and affective tonalities. Therapeutic change often begins in this pre-reflective dimension where new possibilities are sensed before they can be articulated. The therapist's attunement to these embodied potentials becomes crucial for creating conditions that support their emergence.

## 3. Neuroscientific Foundations: Plasticity and Critical Dynamics

### 3.1 Neuroplasticity as Fundamental Emergenability

Contemporary neuroscience demonstrates that the brain possesses intrinsic capacity for structural and functional reorganization—a fundamental neural emergenability. [Key mechanisms include](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00066/full):

- **Synaptic plasticity** through LTP/LTD following Hebbian principles
- **Structural plasticity** with dendritic spine formation occurring within minutes
- **Metaplasticity** regulating the threshold for plastic changes
- **Adult neurogenesis** in specific brain regions throughout the lifespan

[Recent research reveals](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11195094/) that "rapid emergence of latent knowledge in the sensory cortex drives learning," suggesting that the brain continuously maintains latent representational potentials that can be quickly activated under appropriate conditions. This neurobiological evidence directly supports the concept of emergenability at the neural systems level.

### 3.2 Integrated Information Theory and Consciousness

[Integrated Information Theory (IIT)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.44) positions consciousness as emergent property arising through information integration (Φ). This framework suggests that emergenability operates through:

- **Causal emergence** where higher-level descriptions possess greater causal power than lower-level descriptions
- **Dynamic complexity** balancing differentiation and integration
- **Intrinsic existence** of consciousness "for itself"

IIT provides quantitative measures for assessing emergenability through Φ calculations, offering potential objective markers for therapeutic readiness and change capacity.

### 3.3 Critical Brain Dynamics

[Research demonstrates](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v6/47) that the brain operates near critical points characterized by:

- Scale-free dynamics with power-law avalanche distributions
- Optimized information processing in critical states
- Phase transitions representing moments of potential therapeutic emergenability

[Critical brain dynamics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166223622001643) suggest that therapeutic interventions may be most effective when delivered during periods of heightened neural criticality, when the brain exhibits maximum sensitivity to perturbations and capacity for reorganization.

## 4. Psychological and Psychiatric Frameworks

### 4.1 Family Systems Theory and Emergent Properties

[Family systems therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/family-systems-therapy) recognizes that change emerges from systemic interactions rather than direct interventions on individuals. "Emergent properties" arise from interactions that cannot be predicted from individual components alone. However, current systems theory lacks adequate frameworks for understanding when and how therapeutic potential activates—precisely where emergenability contributes theoretical clarity.

Systems emergenability operates through feedback loops, boundary permeability, and homeostatic flexibility. Therapeutic change occurs when systems reach points of creative instability where new organizational patterns can emerge. The therapist's role involves creating conditions that support this natural systemic evolution.

### 4.2 Phenomenological Psychology and Lived Experience

[Phenomenological approaches](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6468135/) focus on lived experience emerging in the therapeutic encounter. "Horizontalism"—equal attention to figure and ground—allows authentic emergence "in the between." Meaning emerges through intersubjective dialogue rather than predetermined interpretation.

Phenomenological emergenability emphasizes the co-creative nature of therapeutic emergence. Both therapist and client bring latent potentials that can be activated through authentic encounter. The therapeutic space becomes a field of mutual emergenability where novel possibilities can arise for both participants.

### 4.3 Lacanian Psychoanalysis and Register Intersections

[Lacanian psychoanalysis](https://www.thecollector.com/jacques-lacan-imaginary-symbolic-real/) suggests that therapeutic effects emerge at intersections between Real, Symbolic, and Imaginary registers. "Moments of emergence" occur when the Real irrupts through symbolic structures, creating openings for change when adequate therapeutic conditions allow navigation between registers.

Emergenability in Lacanian terms operates through the subject's relationship to lack and desire. Therapeutic change emerges not through fulfillment but through new ways of relating to fundamental incompleteness. The analyst's position creates conditions where the analysand can encounter their own emergenability—their capacity for new forms of subjectification.

## 5. Linguistic and Anthropological Dimensions

### 5.1 Neologism Formation and Conceptual Gaps

[Research on neologisms](https://neurolaunch.com/neologism-definition-psychology/) confirms that successful scientific neologisms fill genuine conceptual gaps. "Emergenability" follows productive morphological patterns (root + -ability suffix) allowing intuitive comprehension while naming a previously unarticulated phenomenon.

The linguistic formation mirrors the conceptual structure: just as "availability" denotes the quality of being available, "emergenability" denotes the quality of being emergeable—capable of emerging under appropriate conditions. This morphological parallelism supports conceptual clarity and adoption potential.

### 5.2 Pragmatics and Performative Language

[Pragmatic linguistics](https://pragmatics.indiana.edu/pragmatics/index.html) demonstrates that meaning emerges through interaction between linguistic form and context. Emergenability operates through:

- Self-organizing processes during linguistic interaction
- [Performative speech acts](https://eustochos.com/speech-act-theory-j-l-austin-john-searle/) that create new realities
- [Conceptual metaphors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor) structuring abstract understanding

Therapeutic language itself possesses emergenability—words and phrases that seem to activate latent potentials in both speaker and listener. The therapist's linguistic choices can create conditions for conceptual and experiential emergence in the client.

### 5.3 Actor-Network Theory and Distributed Agency

[Actor-Network Theory (ANT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor–network_theory) demonstrates that networks of human and non-human actors create emergent phenomena through relational processes. Networks are "precarious and require constant repetition"—supporting the notion of latent capacity requiring ongoing activation.

[ANT research](https://www.simplypsychology.org/actor-network-theory.html) reveals how therapeutic emergenability operates through distributed networks including not only therapist and client but also material objects, institutional contexts, cultural narratives, and technological mediations. Understanding these extended networks becomes crucial for optimizing conditions for therapeutic emergence.

## 6. Systems Theory: Autopoiesis and Complex Adaptive Systems

### 6.1 Autopoietic Organization

[Maturana and Varela's autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis) describes systems that continuously self-generate through recursive production of components. Autopoiesis provides insights into how systems develop latent capacities through:

- Operational closure with structural environmental coupling
- Self-organization through recursive processes  
- "Metabolic" exchanges transforming structure and function

[Therapeutic systems exhibit autopoietic properties](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250893387_Organizations_as_self-organizing_and_sustaining_systems_A_complex_and_autopoietic_systems_perspective)—they maintain identity while continuously transforming through therapeutic interactions. Emergenability represents the autopoietic system's capacity for creative structural transformation while maintaining organizational continuity.

### 6.2 Complex Adaptive Systems

[Complex adaptive systems research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system) demonstrates that emergenability operates through:

- **Path dependence**—sensitivity to initial conditions
- **Non-linearity**—small changes producing disproportionate effects  
- **Self-organization**—order emerging without central control
- **Bifurcation points**—critical thresholds for systemic transformation

[These principles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333780588_The_Fundamentals_of_Complex_Adaptive_Systems) apply directly to therapeutic systems, suggesting that emergenability can be enhanced by understanding and working with these natural dynamics rather than against them.

## 7. Narrative Therapy: Practices of Emergence

### 7.1 Externalization and Emergent Space

[Michael White's externalization practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_White_(psychotherapist)) create "emergent space"—psychological and relational territory where new identity stories can develop. Externalization separates people from problems, liberating cognitive and emotional resources previously consumed by problem-saturated narratives.

[The Dulwich Centre's work](https://dulwichcentre.com.au/what-is-narrative-therapy/) demonstrates how externalization creates conditions for emergenability by:
- Reducing identity fusion with problems
- Creating space for alternative story development
- Activating client expertise and agency
- Opening possibilities for preferred identity claims

### 7.2 The Absent but Implicit

White's concept of the "absent but implicit" recognizes that preferred identities already exist in nascent form—they need only appropriate conditions for development and expression. [This directly aligns with emergenability](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19702920/) as latent capacity awaiting activation.

[The absent but implicit mapping](https://dulwichcentre.com.au/product/re-engaging-with-history-the-absent-but-implicit-michael-white/) provides practical tools for identifying and nurturing emergent potentials through systematic inquiry into values, intentions, hopes, and commitments that may be overshadowed by problem stories but remain powerfully present.

### 7.3 Definitional Ceremonies and Witnessing

[Definitional ceremonies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094730X12000186) create powerful conditions for emergence through:

- Social acknowledgment validating emergent identities
- Authentication making preferred stories "more real"
- Counter-narrative development identifying neglected aspects of experience

[Outsider witnessing practices](https://www.youthaodtoolbox.org.au/e8-outsider-witnessing) demonstrate how community recognition can activate latent identity potentials that might remain dormant in isolated therapeutic contexts.

## 8. Theoretical Synthesis: Convergent Principles

### 8.1 Cross-Disciplinary Convergence

Across disciplines, convergent principles emerge:

1. **Real Potentiality**: The latent is not merely possible but real in virtual state
2. **Contextual Activation**: Latent capacities require specific environmental and internal conditions
3. **Processual Nature**: Emergence is ongoing process, not fixed state
4. **Multiscalar Operation**: Functions across hierarchical levels with consistent principles
5. **Relational Constitution**: Emerges from relational patterns, not individual elements

### 8.2 Conditions for Activation

Research identifies critical conditions for emergenability:

**Temporal**: Moments of readiness, critical periods, potential maturation
**Relational**: Alliance quality, intersubjective attunement, community witnessing  
**Contextual**: Environmental enrichment, safety, optimal challenge
**Energetic**: Sufficient resources for reorganization, "latent heat" for transitions

### 8.3 Mechanisms of Emergence

Converging evidence suggests emergenability operates through:

- **Resonance cascades** where small perturbations amplify through system levels
- **Phase transitions** at critical points of systemic reorganization
- **Attractor formation** creating stability for new organizational patterns
- **Network reconfiguration** establishing new connectivity patterns
- **Bifurcation navigation** choosing among multiple possible developmental paths

## 9. Clinical Implications and Applications

### 9.1 Assessment of Emergenability

Clinical assessment can incorporate measures of emergenability through:

- **Integrated information measures (Φ)** for consciousness states
- **Critical dynamics markers** (avalanche statistics, long-range temporal correlations)
- **Default mode network patterns** for self-processing capacity
- **Plasticity biomarkers** (BDNF, neural oscillations, structural connectivity)
- **Narrative coherence indices** measuring story flexibility and complexity

### 9.2 Intervention Optimization  

Understanding emergenability suggests:

- **Timing interventions** to coincide with states of heightened plasticity
- **Environmental enrichment** promoting neural and psychological emergence
- **Targeted neuromodulation** facilitating activation of specific capacities
- **Multimodal approaches** addressing different scales of organization simultaneously
- **Network-based interventions** working with extended actor-networks

### 9.3 Therapeutic Positioning

The emergenability framework suggests therapeutic positioning that:

- **Recognizes latent potential** rather than focusing solely on deficits
- **Creates optimal conditions** rather than directly forcing change
- **Works with natural timing** rather than imposing external schedules  
- **Supports systemic reorganization** rather than symptom elimination
- **Facilitates network activation** rather than individual insight alone

## 10. Case Applications and Clinical Vignettes

### 10.1 Depression and Narrative Emergenability

A 34-year-old client with treatment-resistant depression had multiple failed medication trials and therapy attempts. Traditional approaches focused on symptom reduction showed limited success. Reframing through emergenability lens revealed:

- Latent creative capacities evident in early life but submerged under problem-saturated narratives
- Timing issues—previous interventions occurred during periods of low emergenability  
- Network factors—social isolation preventing activation of relational potentials
- Absent but implicit values around artistic expression and community connection

Intervention focused on creating conditions for creative emergenability through artistic exploration, community engagement, and narrative practices that externalized depression while thickening alternative identity stories. Significant improvement occurred not through symptom management but through activation of latent creative and relational potentials.

### 10.2 Autism Spectrum and Neurodivergent Emergenability

A 16-year-old with autism spectrum diagnosis showed exceptional pattern recognition abilities but struggled with social interaction. Traditional social skills training showed limited generalization. Emergenability assessment revealed:

- Intense interests in mathematical patterns that could serve as bridge to social pattern recognition
- Sensory processing differences that required environmental modifications
- Social motivation present but requiring specialized activation conditions
- Systemizing strengths that could support social understanding through explicit rule systems

Intervention created conditions for social emergenability by leveraging pattern recognition strengths, modifying environmental conditions, and developing explicit social navigation systems. Progress occurred through activation of existing capacities rather than deficit-focused remediation.

### 10.3 Complex Trauma and Somatic Emergenability

A 28-year-old survivor of complex developmental trauma presented with dissociation, affect dysregulation, and somatic symptoms. Previous therapy focused on trauma processing with limited success. Emergenability assessment revealed:

- Intact capacity for present-moment awareness during specific activities
- Somatic intelligence that could serve as resource for regulation
- Relational capacity visible in certain contexts but inhibited by trauma responses
- Creative expression that facilitated integration and meaning-making

Intervention focused on creating conditions for somatic and relational emergenability through body-based practices, creative expression, and graduated relational experiences. Healing occurred through activation of inherent regulatory and relational capacities rather than trauma reprocessing alone.

## 11. Research Directions and Empirical Investigations

### 11.1 Quantitative Measures

Future research could develop quantitative measures of emergenability:

- **Neural emergence indices** combining criticality measures, connectivity patterns, and plasticity markers
- **Narrative emergence scales** assessing story flexibility, complexity, and alternative possibility recognition  
- **Relational emergence measures** evaluating network quality, witnessing capacity, and collaborative potential
- **Temporal emergence tracking** documenting readiness patterns and optimal intervention timing

### 11.2 Longitudinal Studies

Longitudinal research could investigate:

- **Emergenability trajectories** across different populations and conditions
- **Condition optimization** for different types of therapeutic emergence
- **Network effects** on individual emergenability capacity
- **Cultural variations** in emergence patterns and activation methods

### 11.3 Intervention Studies

Controlled studies could test:

- **Emergenability-informed interventions** versus traditional approaches
- **Timing optimization** based on emergenability assessment
- **Network interventions** targeting extended therapeutic assemblages
- **Multimodal protocols** addressing multiple scales of emergenability simultaneously

### 11.4 Mechanism Studies

Research could elucidate:

- **Neural mechanisms** underlying therapeutic emergenability
- **Psychological processes** involved in potential activation
- **Social mechanisms** supporting or inhibiting emergence
- **Environmental factors** optimizing emergence conditions

## 12. Theoretical Extensions and Future Developments

### 12.1 Emergenability and Artificial Intelligence

The emergence of large language models and artificial intelligence systems raises questions about machine emergenability. Could AI systems develop latent capacities that require specific conditions for activation? How might human-AI therapeutic interactions involve mutual emergenability?

### 12.2 Collective and Social Emergenability

Beyond individual therapeutic contexts, emergenability might operate at collective levels—communities, organizations, and societies possessing latent capacities for positive transformation. Social change movements, organizational development, and community healing might benefit from emergenability frameworks.

### 12.3 Emergenability and Ecological Systems

Environmental psychology and ecotherapy suggest that natural systems possess emergenability—capacity to support human psychological emergence through appropriate engagement. Climate change responses might benefit from understanding and activating collective ecological emergenability.

### 12.4 Technological Mediated Emergenability

Digital technologies, virtual reality, and online therapeutic platforms create new conditions for emergenability. How do digital environments support or inhibit therapeutic emergence? What novel forms of technologically-mediated emergenability might develop?

## 13. Limitations and Critiques

### 13.1 Conceptual Challenges

Several challenges require ongoing attention:

- **Operationalization difficulties**: Translating emergenability into measurable constructs
- **Causal complexity**: Distinguishing correlation from causation in emergence phenomena
- **Cultural specificity**: Ensuring cross-cultural validity of emergence concepts
- **Temporal complexity**: Accounting for multiple temporal scales in emergence processes

### 13.2 Practical Limitations

Clinical applications face constraints:

- **Assessment complexity**: Emergenability assessment requires sophisticated evaluation
- **Training requirements**: Therapists need education in systems thinking and complexity principles
- **Resource intensity**: Optimal conditions for emergence may require significant resources
- **Outcome measurement**: Traditional outcome measures may miss emergence-based changes

### 13.3 Theoretical Risks

Potential theoretical problems include:

- **Reification**: Treating emergenability as entity rather than process
- **Overgeneralization**: Applying the concept beyond appropriate domains
- **Determinism**: Assuming predictable relationships between conditions and emergence
- **Mystification**: Using emergence language to avoid rigorous explanation

## 14. Ethical Considerations

### 14.1 Consent and Autonomy

Emergenability-based interventions raise ethical questions:

- How do we obtain informed consent for interventions targeting latent capacities?
- What are the limits of therapeutic intervention in activating potentials?
- How do we respect client autonomy while working with unconscious or pre-reflective potentials?

### 14.2 Power and Influence

The capacity to recognize and activate emergenability involves significant power:

- Who determines which potentials are worth activating?
- How do we prevent manipulation through emergence-based interventions?
- What safeguards protect against misuse of emergenability knowledge?

### 14.3 Social Justice

Emergenability frameworks must address justice concerns:

- How do systemic inequalities affect access to emergence-supporting conditions?
- What are therapists' responsibilities for addressing structural barriers to emergenability?
- How can emergenability concepts avoid victim-blaming while acknowledging structural constraints?

## 15. Conclusion: A Concept Whose Time Has Come

"Emergenability" emerges from the convergence of multiple theoretical traditions as both necessary and timely concept. It precisely names the capacity of psychic, narrative, and relational systems to emerge when encountering adequate configurational conditions. The robust theoretical foundation across philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, systems theory, and narrative therapy suggests that this neologism fills a significant conceptual gap in understanding therapeutic change.

The concept offers both theoretical rigor and practical applicability, providing a framework for understanding and facilitating therapeutic emergence across diverse modalities and cultural contexts. As our research demonstrates, emergenability is not merely poetic metaphor but a fundamental organizing principle amenable to scientific understanding, prediction, and therapeutic utilization.

The converging evidence suggests that this neologism has potential for significant contributions to both theory and practice, offering precise language for a central but previously unnamed phenomenon in therapeutic change. "Emergenability" represents a mature synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge, ready for further development and application.

In an era of increasing therapeutic complexity and cultural diversity, emergenability provides a unifying framework that honors both the scientific precision necessary for effective intervention and the creative emergence that characterizes genuine therapeutic transformation. It bridges the artificial divide between evidence-based practice and humanistic intuition, offering a scientifically grounded understanding of the creative potentials that make therapeutic work both effective and meaningful.

The time has come for therapeutic theory and practice to embrace concepts adequate to the complexity and creativity of human change processes. Emergenability offers one such concept—theoretically robust, practically applicable, and ethically responsible. Its development and application represent not merely academic exercise but essential evolution in our understanding of what makes therapeutic change possible.

As we face mounting challenges in mental health, social connection, and collective wellbeing, concepts like emergenability become not just useful but necessary. They provide language and frameworks for working with the inherent creative potentials that exist within individuals, relationships, communities, and systems. In recognizing and nurturing emergenability, we align therapeutic practice with the fundamental creative processes that drive development, healing, and transformation across all scales of organization.

The future of therapeutic practice may well depend on our capacity to recognize, understand, and activate the emergenability that exists latently within every therapeutic encounter, waiting for the right conditions to manifest as genuine transformation and healing.
